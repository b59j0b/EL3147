Introduction
This Assessment Pack consists of a detailed assignment brief, guidance on what you need to prepare. You’ll also find information on this page to guide you on how, where, and when to submit. There will be a support session for this coursework on Thursday 12th Dec 2024 during the class. If you need additional support, please make a note of the services detailed in this document.  

Submission details - How, when, and where to submit:
Assessment Release Date: Thursday, 12/12/2024
Assessment Deadline: 	13:59pm, Friday, 11/04/2025
	Please note this is the final time you can submit, not the time to submit.	
You should submit your report via Turnitin on Blackboard space of EL3147
The link on Blackboard will be available from: 11/02/2025. 
Feedback will be provided by: 02/05/2025
This assignment constitutes 25% of the total module assessment mark. You are expected to write a report to summarise your work on the tasks defined in the assignment brief below, particularly the Table 1 which gives a template of how your report shall be structured. Your report shall start with a very short introduction describing the image enhancement methods used, including histogram equalisation and gamma correction. 
Your report has a word limit of 1000 words, excluding the references/appendices it might have. 
You should use Harvard reference style in the report. 
Your submission should be one zipped file which includes: 
othe report in word or pdf 
othe Matlab program you designed as a .m file, with comments included
oall the images used in the assignment
Your submitted zipped file should be accessible, i.e., don’t use password protection.

Note: If you have any valid mitigating circumstances that mean you cannot meet an assessment submission deadline and you wish to request an extension, you will need to apply online, via MyUCLan with your evidence prior to the deadline. Further information on Mitigating Circumstances via this link.
We wish you all success in completing your assessment. Read this guidance carefully, and any questions, please discuss with your Module Leader. 
Teaching into assessment:
The assignment is going to be discussed at the lecture on 12/12/2024. The background of this assignment will be introduced and the tasks will be explained. Questions from students will be addressed during this support session.

Assignment brief 
This assignment is designed to give you an insight into selected aspects o代 写EL3147、Java/c++
代做程序编程语言f digital image processing. You are asked to produce your image processing programs in Matlab, apply these programs and evaluate the results to obtain findings. 
This assignment will enable you to:
develop and apply appropriate representation and analysis techniques for digital signals and images
design, analyse, select, and apply 1-D and 2-D digital filters
create, and analyse the performance of, processing systems for digital signals and/or images for particular practical applications based on analysis of the signals/images using an appropriate fast prototyping software development platform.
The above items correspond to the Intended Learning Outcomes 2, 3  4 of module descriptor.

This assignment consists of two tasks (T1, T2). 

The first task (T1) is to make your own Matlab program, apply it to the images (see Fig. 1) and evaluate the results obtained. Here you can use image processing toolbox functions for Hough transform (e.g., hough, houghpeaks, edge). 
a.Show your code and the results in processing Fig_1a  Fig_1b.
b.Find out whether long lines in Fig_1a are parallel to each other. Show your evidence and explain why.
c.Find out whether long lines in Fig_1b are parallel to each other. Show your evidence and explain why.

The second task (T2) is to design your own program for T1, without using the image processing toolbox functions for Hough transform, specifically, no ‘hough’, no ‘houghpeaks’ but ‘edge’ is allowed.  
a.Show your code and the results in processing Fig_1a  Fig_1b. Note: Your code should be YOURS, not from anyone else. If we find two pieces of code identical, both submissions will be awarded 0 for T2. 
b.Explain how you design your own ‘hough’. Note: your version shall be different from what is given from Matlab. Your version shall not be longer than 50 lines of Matlab code. Its input is an edge image and its outputs are: an accumulator, alpha vector, radius vector.
c.Evaluate the computational complexity of your program and compare it with your T1 program.

Fig. 1a and 1b can be downloaded from EL3147’s Blackboard / Assignments folder.
You will summarize your work in a report, which shall include two appendices: one for T1, one for T2. Your report shall be submitted to Blackboard for marking.
